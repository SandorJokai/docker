<h1>About Docker</h1>

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files, they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
This way of using can able to share any software installation without worrying about any dependencies or limitations.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

- docker engine must be installed
- be able to use some basic docker commands

<h1>What can we do with using Docker?</h2>

Literally anything. Back in the old days before DevOps, where the developers and operations engineers couldn't always share their work properly. There always has been limitation this way or another. Docker can solve these types of problems in a really efficient way of using the kernel, the Hypervisor and stuff like that as results without worrying about any dependencies or limitations on any systems installed docker.


One one the most easiest and enjoyable way of working with containers is making micro-services.

Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

<h1>Docker-ish tools</h1>

There are some other tools, based on docker. Docker-compose is one of them. I have another [project](https://github.com/SandorJokai/docker/tree/master/owncloud) in this repository, where I show how to use docker-compose. Docker-compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

There are another docker-based tool called docker-swarm. Docker-swarm is an orchestration tool where we can able to work with containers in a bit more sophisticated way. There are nodes and workers works together and the node manages all the background operations.

I am not using docker-swarm. I use Kubernetes instead.
